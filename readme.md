# StealthSurfer, "Be a level above."

StealthSurfer is a website that can easily help you navigate web proxies, used to unblock websites such as Discord, Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, and that's just to name a few!

## How is it so fast?

It uses XHR requests to pull the JSON files in order to require less information, and it saves those files in localStorage and calls upon them for quick loading. Then it checks if the JSON files have been updated.

## Notable Features

StealthSurfer strides to be on top of proxy sites regarding features! With this, we've added some features you've never seen before:

``Save as Default`` : Instead of having to select a proxy **EVERYTIME** you visit proxy websites, you can now save it as your default proxy! This can be activated when you first visit the site, by clicking the "GO!" button after the type the link you'd like to unblock. You'll be prompted with a modal asking you to select a proxy, and you'll notice a little box asking "Would you like to save this proxy as your default selection?" Better yet, this doesn't ONLY apply to proxies, this will apply to themes (see below)

``Customizable CSS`` : "What's so special about changing the design? I can do that from the code!" Well, you can now do it straight from the site! This can be done by hovering over the "Settings" tab in the navigation bar, and selecting a theme and font. From some extensive research, no other proxy site has implemented this feature

``Stealth Mode`` : Anytime you input a link, your result will become an something similar to Alloy Proxy! In the 'Settings' tab, you can choose if you want your URL to be encoded in B64 (Base-64), encoded based on IP, and encoded based on cookie to make it more stealthy! This proxy is a StealthSurfer exclusive, quite literally called StealthSurfer. It supports about every website!
  
  And many more features that will be added towards the first release
